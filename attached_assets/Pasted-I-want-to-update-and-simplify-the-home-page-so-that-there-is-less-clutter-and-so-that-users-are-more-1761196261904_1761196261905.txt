I want to update and simplify the home page so that there is less clutter and so that users are more easily directed to what they need. Let’s do this as follows:

Simplify the home page so under the title and the heading “get free legal guidance, understand…” there are just two buttons: Get Started on top, and “Urgent Help Needed” underneath. 
If you click Urgent Help Needed, you get the current popup
If you click on the “Get Started” button, get a popup menu with the prompt “What Do You Need?” with a menu of the following options:
Get Guidance For My Case (if clicked, go to the top of the /case-guidance page)
Immigration Enforcement (if clicked, go to the /immigration-guidance page)
Legal Rights Info - if clicked, have a follow-up menu with the following options:
Your Constitutional Rights (if clicked, go to the /rights-info page, which will be updated as described below)
Criminal Justice Process (if clicked, go to a new /process page, described in more detail below)
Search and Seizure (if clicked, go to a new /search-seizure page, described in more detail below)
Assisting Friends or Family (if clicked, go to a new /friends-family page, described in more detail below)
Legal Glossary
Legal Aid Resources & Support - if clicked, have a follow-up menu with the options:
Find Public Defender (if clicked, show the “Find Public Defender Offices” popup with the zip code search bar)
Legal Aid Organizations (if clicked, show the “Find Legal Aid Organizations” popup with the zip code search bar)
Diversion Programs (if clicked, go to the /diversion-programs page)
Records Expungement (if clicked, go to /record-expungement)
Design the menus so that they are catchy and interesting. I don’t want them to just be boring text. However, the design should match the rest of the sights and the other menus/popups. 
Remove the following from the home page:
“Learn Your Rights & Legal Process” heading, button, and description
“Get Guidance for My Case” heading, button, and description
“Know Your Rights” section, along with the “essential legal information…” description and the six buttons/descriptions below that
The personalized assessment section
Add a “Navigating This Tool” button which links to a new /how-to page, which explains all of the resources that the website has and short descriptions of each resource. The things we deleted from the home page can appear there.  
Update the /rights-info page to:
Remove the Get Personalized Guidance button
Move the Criminal Justice Process Timeline section to the new /process page
Remove the Legal Resources & Support section
Create a new /search-seizure page which outlines a person’s rights if they are subject to:
A stop and frisk
A search of their car
A search of their home (or if a law enforcement officer asks to enter their dwelling)
A search of their person
If a law enforcement officer asks to see a person’s phone, or asks them to unlock their phone
Generally how to behave initially when approached by or interacting with a law enforcement officer
Create a new /friends-family page that is essentially a one pager for what to do if your friend or family member is arrested or detained
Make sure the “Our Mission” link in the footer on all pages links to the /mission-statement page. 
Remove “Crisis Support” and “Community Help” and “Emergency Resources” from the Footer
Move “Diversion Programs” under the “Get Help” heading on the Footer
Make sure “Court Procedures” in the footer links to the /process page 
Add “Assisting Others” under the “Legal Resources” heading in the footer and link it to /friends-family page
Make sure links to other pages take the user to the top of the other page (many of the links currently drop the user to the middle or bottom of a given page). 
Make sure all of the new and updated pages are mobile friendly
