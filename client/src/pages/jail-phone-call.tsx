              Jails are required to notify you that calls are recorded, but this warning is easy to miss. Prosecutors have used jail calls as key evidence in countless cases, including statements made to family members.
              The one exception is calls to your attorney — those <em>should</em> be privileged, though you should still verify with your attorney that the line is properly designated.
