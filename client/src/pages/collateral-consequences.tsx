                    California's CalGang database is one of the largest; a 2016 audit found significant errors, including minors and individuals with no gang ties being listed. Similar concerns have been raised about Chicago's database and New York's gang database. Many states do not require notification when someone is added, making it difficult to challenge the designation.
